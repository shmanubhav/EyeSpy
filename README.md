# EyeSpy
A potential treatment to living with Amblyopia, Stribismus and Macular Degenration using a 3D Unity game and an eye-tracker.

## Running the game (on Windows)
1. Connect your Tobii Eye Tracker and make sure Gaze tracking is working.
2. Open the desired level folder (l1-explode) and double click on `EyeSpy.exe`.
3. Consistent gaze on the teal ball (Focus Area) will make the Red box (Object Stimuli) spin. The longer you look at the ball the faster the cube will rotate. As soon as you look directly at the cube, it disappears mimicking central vision loss.
4. Press the escape key to exit the game.
